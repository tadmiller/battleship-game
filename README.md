# Homework 2: Let's Play a Game!

Play a multiplayer game of your choosing over I2C. Find the full specification in `hw03.pdf`.

## Deadline

This assignment is due Monday, Feb 27th at 6:00 PM. You will need to demo your circuit before lecture and *each* member of your team needs to be able to explain any part of the assignment. Please ensure that this repository contains the following:

  - One sketch for each Arduino on your bus (2 or 3, depending on the size of your group)
  - A `pdf` document outlining the design of your system (full requirements can be found in `hw03.pdf`)

## Using `git`

Remember to keep your repository history clean, with many small commits and descriptive commit messages. We want to be able to see the progression of your thoughts through the commit log, **not** just a single commit with all your code (and this will be reflected in your grade).

For the most part, the following commands will be all you need:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git status` (*always* use this before committing)
  - `git diff -stat`
  - `git push`
  - `git pull`
  - `git clone`

  You can learn about each of these using the internet, or `git help X` where `X` is the command portion of the above examples.
